## 🗝️ What is OpenKeys?

OpenKeys is a _free_ Windows program to simplify the repeated entry of text.

### 📦 Installation:

Extract the `OpenKeys.zip` from the latest release to any directory on your
PC. We recommend `C:\Program Files\OpenKeys` but any directory will do.

When you run OpenKeys for the first time a `shortcuts.json` will be created
in `%APPDATA%\OpenKeys\` with some default entries. Edit this JSON file to
fit your needs and start inserting text.
