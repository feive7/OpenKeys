## üóùÔ∏è What is OpenKeys?

OpenKeys is a _free_ Windows program to simplify the repeated entry of text.

### üì¶ Installation:

Extract the `OpenKeys.zip` from the latest release to any directory on your PC. We recommend `C:\Program Files\OpenKeys` but any directory will do. 

When you run OpenKeys for the first time a `shortcuts.json` will be created with some default entries. Edit this JSON file to fit your needs and start inserting text.
